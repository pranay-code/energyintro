      <h2>Powering Modern Life</h2>
      <p>Electricity is the invisible lifeblood of our civilization. From the moment we wake up to the streetlights that guide us home, it powers everything. But have you ever wondered how this energy actually reaches you?</p>
      
      <h3>Making Sense of the Chaos</h3>
      <p>The energy world is full of complex terms like "Grid Frequency", "Renewables", and "Forecasting". It can feel overwhelming.</p>
      <p><strong>Don't worry.</strong> This portal is designed to clear that confusion. We will break down these complex concepts into simple, interactive visualisations. By the end of this journey, you will feel completely at home in the world of energy.</p>
      <p><em>Flip the switch below to see how energy brings a city to life.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"intro-widget"},{id:"energy",title:"Energy: The Basics",content:`
      <h2>The Capacity to Perform Work</h2>
      <p>Energy is the ability to do work. In our industry, we focus on converting <strong>Primary Energy</strong> (raw resources) into <strong>Secondary Energy</strong> (Electricity).</p>
      <p>While the final product (Electricity) is always the same, the journey to get there depends on the source. Some paths are long and complex (like Coal), while others are direct and elegant (like Solar).</p>
      
      <p><em>Click the icons below to see how different sources transform into power.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"energy-converter"},{id:"types",title:"Common Energy Conversions",content:`
      <h2>Forms & Transformations</h2>
      <p>As you saw above, we often force energy through multiple forms to get what we want:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chemical:</strong> Stored in bonds (Coal, Biomass).</li>
        <li><strong>Thermal:</strong> Released as heat (Fire).</li>
        <li><strong>Kinetic:</strong> Movement (Wind, Steam Turbine).</li>
        <li><strong>Gravitational:</strong> Height (Water in a dam).</li>
        <li><strong>Radiant:</strong> Light (Sunlight).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Solar PV is unique because it skips the "Mechanical" step entirely, converting light directly to electrons. This is why it has no moving parts!
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>Each transformation step incurs a loss. A thermal plant has many steps (Chemical -> Thermal -> Kinetic -> Electrical), leading to lower efficiency (~35%). Solar PV is unique: it goes directly from Electromagnetic (Light) -> Electrical, skipping the mechanical steps.</p>
      <p><em>Next: How do we mechanically generate this power?</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"types-matrix"},{id:"generation",title:"Generation Mechanics",content:`
      <h2>Spinning Magnets & Glowing Silicon</h2>
      <p><strong>Thermal/Wind/Hydro:</strong> Almost all traditional power generation relies on <strong>Electromagnetic Induction</strong>. We use a fuel (Coal/Wind/Water) to spin a magnet inside a coil of wire. The changing magnetic field pushes electrons, creating current.</p>
      <p><strong>Solar PV:</strong> This is the exception. It uses the <strong>Photo-electric effect</strong>. Photons from the sun strike a silicon semiconductor, knocking electrons loose and creating a flow of current directly. No moving parts.</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> A bicycle dynamo uses your leg power (Kinetic) to spin a magnet, lighting up the lamp. A solar calculator uses light to power the screen.
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>Mechanical plants (Wind/Coal) need lubrication, gearbox maintenance, and bearing replacements. Solar plants are solid-state but need panel cleaning to maintain efficiency. The physics dictates the O&M (Operations & Maintenance) strategy.</p>
      <p><em>Next: Once generated, we need to move it. Enter Electricity.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"turbine-logic"},{id:"electricity",title:"Electricity & Efficiency",content:`
      <h2>The Perfect Carrier</h2>
      <p>Electricity is the preferred energy carrier because it can be transmitted instantly over long distances with relatively low losses. It is "Weightless" energy.</p>
      <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> However, generating it is inefficient. In a coal plant, the <strong>Carnot Limit</strong> restricts us. For every 100 units of energy in coal, we only get ~35-40 units of electricity. The remaining 60 units are lost as waste heat.</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> If you buy 100 apples (Coal Energy) but drop 65 of them on the way home (Heat Loss), you only get to eat 35 (Electricity). That is the reality of thermal power.
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>That 65% loss is money up the chimney. Improving efficiency by even 0.1% is a massive engineering goal. This is why we track "Heat Rate" (kCal/kWh) obsessively.</p>
      <p><em>Next: Where does this electricity go? Into the Grid.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"efficiency-waterfall"},{id:"grid-purpose",title:"What is the Grid?",content:`
      <h2>The World's Largest Machine</h2>
      <p>The "Grid" is not just wires; it is a synchronized ecosystem. It connects Generators (Supply) to Consumers (Demand) via Transmission (High Voltage) and Distribution (Low Voltage) networks.</p>
      <p>It acts like a giant pool. Generators pour water (electrons) in, and consumers drain it out. The level (Frequency) must stay constant.</p>
      
      <div style="text-align:center; margin: 20px 0;">
        <img src="./grid-ecosystem.png" style="max-width:100%; border-radius:12px; box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);">
        <p style="font-size:0.8rem; color:#666; margin-top:5px">The Grid Ecosystem: From Generation to Consumption</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>We don't just sell to a customer; we inject into this shared pool. If the pool is full (congestion) or the pipes are too small (transmission constraints), we can't sell our power, even if we can generate it.</p>
      <p><em>Next: What is pouring into this pool right now?</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"transmission-bottleneck"},{id:"mix",title:"Current Energy Mix",content:`
      <h2>The Composition</h2>
      <p>India's grid is a mix of different sources, each playing a role:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Base Load (Coal/Nuclear):</strong> Runs 24/7 to provide the minimum constant demand. High inertia, slow to change.</li>
        <li><strong>Peaking Power (Hydro/Gas):</strong> Can start fast to meet sudden spikes in demand (e.g., evening lighting).</li>
        <li><strong>Renewables (Solar/Wind):</strong> Variable but clean. They are "Must-Run" (Grid must take them).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> Think of Base Load as the steady rhythm of a drum, and Peaking Power as the guitar solos that come in when the song gets intense.
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>We are shifting from a Coal-heavy portfolio to a Green portfolio. This changes how we operate. We are moving from "Controllable" generation to "Variable" generation.</p>
      
      <p>India is on the verge of a historic milestone. As of mid-2025, our <strong>Non-Fossil</strong> installed capacity (Solar, Wind, Hydro, Nuclear) has reached nearly <strong>49%</strong>, almost overtaking Fossil fuels.</p>
      <p>Explore the interactive grid below. Each dot represents ~1% of India's power capacity.</p>
      
      <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; color: #888; margin-top: 10px;"><em>Source: <a href="https://powermin.gov.in/en/content/power-sector-glance-all-india" target="_blank" style="color: #888; text-decoration: underline;">Ministry of Power, Govt. of India (Power Sector at a Glance)</a>.</em></p>
      <p><em>Next: Why the shift? The environmental cost.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"grid-mix"},{id:"impact",title:"Environmental Impact",content:`
      <h2>The Cost of Carbon</h2>
      <p>Burning coal releases CO2 (Global Warming), SOx (Acid Rain), NOx (Smog), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5 - Health Hazard). It also consumes vast amounts of water for cooling.</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> A single large coal plant can emit as much CO2 in a year as 1 million cars.
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>Regulations are tightening. Carbon taxes are coming. Investors (ESG Funds) are refusing to fund coal projects. Being "Green" is no longer just PR; it's a financial survival strategy.</p>
      <p><em>Next: The economic case for Renewables.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"emission-calculator"},{id:"renewables",title:"Need for Renewables",content:`
      <h2>Cheaper & Cleaner</h2>
      <p>Solar and Wind are not just clean; they are now the cheapest sources of new power. The <strong>LCOE (Levelized Cost of Energy)</strong> of Solar has dropped by ~90% in the last decade.</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> In 2010, Solar power cost ₹15/unit. Today, it costs ₹2.50/unit. Coal power costs ₹4.50/unit. The economics have flipped.
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>Low cost means high demand. But "Free Fuel" comes with a catch: Variability. We can't switch the sun on at night.</p>
      <p><em>Next: The challenge of balancing a variable grid.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"lcoe-trend"},{id:"grid-balance",title:"Grid Balance",content:`
      <h2>The 50Hz Heartbeat</h2>
      <p>The grid must operate at exactly 50Hz. This frequency represents the rotational speed of all generators. It is the heartbeat of the system.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Supply = Demand:</strong> Frequency stays at 50Hz.</li>
        <li><strong>Supply < Demand:</strong> Frequency drops (Braking effect).</li>
        <li><strong>Supply > Demand:</strong> Frequency rises (Acceleration).</li>
      </ul>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> Imagine riding a tandem bike. If your partner stops pedaling (Supply drops) but you keep the same gear (Demand), you slow down (Frequency drops).
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>If we fail to provide power when promised, the frequency drops, risking a blackout. The grid operator will penalize us heavily for this.</p>
      <p><em>Next: What happens when the sun sets?</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"grid-purpose"},{id:"challenges",title:"Integration Challenges",content:`
      <h2>The Duck Curve</h2>
      <p>Solar produces too much at noon and zero at night. This creates a "Duck" shape in the net demand curve. The grid needs massive ramping capability to handle the sunset (when solar vanishes but lighting demand spikes).</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> It's like a restaurant that is empty at lunch but has 1000 customers walk in at 7 PM. The kitchen (Grid) is under immense stress to serve everyone instantly.
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>If we generate too much at noon, the grid might "Curtail" us (switch us off) to save the system. We lose revenue during curtailment. We need to predict this.</p>
      <p><em>Next: How do we predict the weather?</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"duck-curve"},{id:"forecasting",title:"Generation Forecasting",content:`
      <h2>The Varying Resource Problem</h2>
      <p>Unlike a coal plant where we control the fuel, <strong>Renewable Energy</strong> depends on nature. We cannot command the wind to blow or the sun to shine.</p>
      
      <h3>Why Forecasting is Critical</h3>
      <p>If we promise to deliver 100MW to the grid but the wind dies down, we destabilize the entire system. This is why we need accurate, hyper-local weather forecasts.</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Try It Yourself:</strong> Use the widget below to see how the resource varies. Change the "Forecast Days" to 3 or 7 days to see the daily cycle of the sun and the unpredictability of the wind.
      </div>
      
      <p>See how the resource is changing? That's why renewable integration is challenging and accurate forecasting is vital.</p>
      <p><em>But what if the forecast goes wrong? What is the financial impact? Let's find out.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"weather-dashboard-v2"},{id:"dsm",title:"DSM & Penalties",content:`
      <h2>Forecast Accuracy = Profitability</h2>
      <p>In the renewable energy sector, the Deviation Settlement Mechanism (DSM) is not just a regulatory fine; it is a critical operational cost. If our actual generation deviates from our forecasted schedule, we pay a heavy price.</p>
      <p><strong>The Business Risk:</strong> Forecast errors directly erode our revenue. Under the latest CERC regulations, we must maintain our generation within a tight band of the available capacity (AVC). Deviating outside this band triggers penalties that can turn a profitable day into a loss.</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Financial Impact Simulator:</strong> Use the tool below to stress-test your portfolio. See how weather uncertainty (Forecast Error) eats into your profit margins.
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>Minimizing DSM penalties is the difference between a successful IPP and a struggling one. This is why we invest millions in advanced weather modelling and AI-based forecasting systems.</p>
      <p><em>Next: How do we solve the variability permanently?</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"penalty-simulator"},{id:"future",title:"Future Technologies",content:`
      <h2>Storage & Hydrogen</h2>
      <p><strong>BESS (Battery Energy Storage):</strong> Batteries allow us to store the noon sun and sell it at night. This solves the Duck Curve.</p>
      <p><strong>Green Hydrogen:</strong> We use renewable electricity to split water (Electrolysis) into Hydrogen. This Hydrogen can be stored for months and used in industries like Steel.</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> Batteries turn "Perishable" electricity (must be used now) into "Non-perishable" electricity (can be used later).
      </div>

      <img src="./bess_hydrogen.png" alt="Battery Energy Storage System and Green Hydrogen Plant" style="width: 100%; border-radius: 8px; margin: 20px 0; box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2);">

      <h3>Use Cases: BESS vs Green Hydrogen</h3>
      <p>While both store energy, they serve different purposes:</p>
      <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
        <li style="background: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.1); padding: 10px; border-radius: 6px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
          <strong>🔋 BESS (Batteries):</strong> Best for <em>Short Duration</em> (4-6 hours). Used for daily day-night balancing and grid stability (Frequency Response).
        </li>
        <li style="background: rgba(3, 169, 244, 0.1); padding: 10px; border-radius: 6px;">
          <strong>💧 Green Hydrogen:</strong> Best for <em>Long Duration</em> (Seasonal storage) and <em>Hard-to-Abate Sectors</em>. It replaces fossil fuels in industries like Steel, Fertilizer, and Shipping.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>This turns intermittent renewable power into firm, round-the-clock power. It allows us to compete directly with coal.</p>
      <p><em>Next: A regulatory nuance.</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"battery-arbitrage"},{id:"clean-vs-renewable",title:"Clean vs Renewable",content:`
      <h2>The Critical Distinction</h2>
      <p>These terms are often used interchangeably, but they mean different things in the energy industry. Understanding the difference is key to understanding policy and carbon markets.</p>
      
      <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 20px; margin: 20px 0;">
        <div style="background: rgba(76, 175, 80, 0.1); padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #4CAF50;">
          <h3 style="margin-top:0; color: #2E7D32;">Renewable Energy</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Definition:</strong> Energy from a source that is not depleted when used.</p>
          <ul style="font-size: 0.85rem; padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">
            <li>☀️ Solar (Sunlight is infinite)</li>

            <li>🌊 Hydro (Water cycle replenishes)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div style="background: rgba(3, 169, 244, 0.1); padding: 15px; border-radius: 8px; border-left: 4px solid #03A9F4;">
          <h3 style="margin-top:0; color: #0277BD;">Clean Energy</h3>
          <p style="font-size: 0.9rem; margin-bottom: 0;"><strong>Definition:</strong> Energy that creates little to no greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
          <ul style="font-size: 0.85rem; padding-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">
            <li>⚛️ Nuclear (Zero Carbon, but finite fuel)</li>
            <li>☀️ Solar / 🌬️ Wind (Zero Carbon)</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h3>The "Nuclear" Nuance</h3>
      <p><strong>Nuclear Power</strong> is the best example of the difference. It is <strong>Clean</strong> (Zero Carbon) but <strong>NOT Renewable</strong> (Uranium is a finite resource mined from the earth). Therefore, Nuclear plants do NOT get RECs (Renewable Energy Certificates).</p>

      <h3>Test Your Understanding</h3>
      <p>Can you correctly classify these energy sources? Play the game below!</p>
    `,widgetType:"energy-sorter"},{id:"carbon-markets",title:"Carbon Markets & RECs",content:`
      <h2>Selling the "Green" Attribute</h2>
      <p>When we generate renewable power, we produce two things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Electricity:</strong> Sold to the grid (e.g., ₹2.50/unit).</li>
        <li><strong>Green Attribute (REC):</strong> A digital certificate proving the power was green.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Companies that pollute (like Steel or Cement factories) buy these RECs to offset their emissions and meet regulatory targets (RPO - Renewable Purchase Obligation).</p>
      
      <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Real World Example:</strong> It's like buying organic vegetables. You pay for the vegetable (Electricity) plus a premium for the "Organic" label (REC).
      </div>

      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>RECs are an additional revenue stream. In some cases, we can sell the power cheaply but make our profit from trading RECs in the carbon market.</p>
      <p><em>Next: Where are these projects located?</em></p>
    `,widgetType:"rec-market"},{id:"statistics",title:"Indian Energy Statistics",content:`
      <h2>The National Picture</h2>
      <p>India is a diverse continent. Resources are not evenly distributed. This is why we need a national market to trade power and RECs.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rajasthan/Gujarat:</strong> High Solar & Wind (The "Saudi Arabia" of Renewables).</li>
        <li><strong>Tamil Nadu:</strong> High Wind.</li>
        <li><strong>Northeast:</strong> High Hydro.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Why We Care</h3>
      <p>We build plants where the resource is best (Rajasthan), but we sell power to where the money is (Commercial states like Maharashtra). This requires Inter-State Transmission System (ISTS) access.</p>
